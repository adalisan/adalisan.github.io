	<h2>About Me</h2>
			<span class="col-md-12 letter">
			<p> I am a machine learning researcher at Raytheon BBN Technologies.  I am interested in different approaches to learning from disparate multiview data, such as multiple kernel learning, canonical correlational analysis, etc. I am also interested in applications of these approaches to graphs and in general, learning from graph data. </p>
  <p>I have a PhD  in
			Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p> My PhD advisor was Carey Priebe. We have worked on projects involving data in dissimilarity representation in addition to graphs. My dissertation research involved using dissimilarity data from disparate sources  in order to solve learning problems. These type of problems are examples of multiview learning and
my approach is a dissimilarity-centric method to find a common representation for the disparate data from different views. An extension of my approach allows the solution of the seeded graph matching problem, a variant of the graph matching problem where a portion of the vertex correspondences are known. </p>

<p>I also have a M.Sc in Engineering from Brown University. I worked in
			computer vision problems at
			<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/LEMS/">
			LEMS</a> lab.</p>
			<p>Also at Johns Hopkins (2007-2009), I was a research assistant in the <a href="http://cvrgrid.org/">
			Cardiovascular Research Grid</a> project, developed code for
			predicting sudden cardiac death or VT/VF events for people implanted
			with ICD devices.</p>

			<p>In addition to becoming familiar with different statistical methods, I also try to gain as much computing skills as I can. Learning R was an arduous journey and I learned to love R  at the end  by repeatedly failing and occasionally succeding.</p>
<p> I also work with Matlab and Python for scientific computing. I have used C/C++ in the past and am trying to relearn them again. </p>
			<p>I like learning new things and solving practical data problems. My two career goals have been to improve my software development skills and learn about new mathematical methods and approaches. You could also say I am a typeface and design enthusiast.</p>
      <p>Like the best of  statistics/data science  practitioners, I am adept at learning new computer languages.</p>
      <p> I worked with  C++, for a long time.  I picked up Python during my PhD which I would say is my (current) favorite computer language.</p>

			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p><span class="auto-style2">I am Sancar Adali. I graduated from
			Applied Mathematics and Statistics Dept. at Johns Hopkins University with a PhD.</p>
			<p>My research interests all fall under machine learning and statistics, with focus on applications.</p>
      <p>
          I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey. I attended Robert College,
      one of the most prestigious high schools in Turkey. For my undergraduate studies, I majored in
      Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Bosphorus University.</p>
