	<h2>About Me</h2>
			<span class="col-md-12 letter">
			<p>I am Sancar Adali. I have a PhD  in 
			Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University. <p> My PhD advisor was Carey Priebe. We have worked on projects involving data in dissimilarity representation in addition to graphs.</p>
<p> My dissertation research involved using dissimilarity data from disparate sources  in order to solve learning problems. These type of problems are examples of multiview learning and
my approach is a dissimilarity-centric method to find a common representation for the disparate data from different views. An extension of my approach allows the solution of the seeded graph matching problem, a variant of the graph matching problem where a portion of the vertex correspondences are known. </p>
<p> I am interested in different approaches to learning from disparate multiview data, such as multiple kernel learning, canonical correlational analysis, etc.</p>

<p>I also have a M.Sc in Engineering from Brown University. I worked in 
			computer vision problems at
			<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/LEMS/">
			LEMS</a> lab.</p>
			<p>At Johns Hopkins (2007-2009), I was a research assistant in the <a href="http://cvrgrid.org/">
			Cardiovascular Research Grid</a> project, developed code for 
			predicting sudden cardiac death or VT/VF events for people implanted 
			with ICD devices.</p>			
			
			<p>In addition to becoming familiar with different statistical methods, I also try to gain as much computing skills as I can. Learning R was an arduous journey and I learned to love R  at the end.</p>
<p> I also work with Matlab and Python for scientific computing.</p>

					I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey. I&nbsp; attended Robert College, 
			one of the most prestigious high schools in Turkey. I studied 
			Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Bosphorus University.</p>
			<p>I like learning new things and solving practical data problems. My two career goals have been to improve my software development skills and learn new mathematics. You could also say I am a typeface and design enthusiast.</p>
