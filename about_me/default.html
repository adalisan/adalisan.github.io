	<h2>About Me</h2>
			<span class="col-md-12 letter">
			<p> I am a machine learning researcher at Raytheon BBN Technologies.  I am interested in different approaches to learning from disparate multiview data, such as multiple kernel learning, canonical correlational analysis, etc. I am also interested in applications of these approaches to graphs and in general, learning from graph data. </p>
  <p>I have a PhD  in 
			Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University.</p> <p> My PhD advisor was Carey Priebe. We have worked on projects involving data in dissimilarity representation in addition to graphs. My dissertation research involved using dissimilarity data from disparate sources  in order to solve learning problems. These type of problems are examples of multiview learning and
my approach is a dissimilarity-centric method to find a common representation for the disparate data from different views. An extension of my approach allows the solution of the seeded graph matching problem, a variant of the graph matching problem where a portion of the vertex correspondences are known. </p>

<p>I also have a M.Sc in Engineering from Brown University. I worked in 
			computer vision problems at
			<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/LEMS/">
			LEMS</a> lab.</p>
			<p>At Johns Hopkins (2007-2009), I was a research assistant in the <a href="http://cvrgrid.org/">
			Cardiovascular Research Grid</a> project, developed code for 
			predicting sudden cardiac death or VT/VF events for people implanted 
			with ICD devices.</p>			
			
			<p>In addition to becoming familiar with different statistical methods, I also try to gain as much computing skills as I can. Learning R was an arduous journey and I learned to love R  at the end.</p>
<p> I also work with Matlab and Python for scientific computing. I have used C/C++ in the past and am trying to relearn them again. </p>
			<p>
					I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey. I attended Robert College, 
			one of the most prestigious high schools in Turkey. For my undergraduate studies, I majored in 
			Electrical and Electronics Engineering in Bosphorus University.</p>
			<p>I like learning new things and solving practical data problems. My two career goals have been to improve my software development skills and learn new mathematics. You could also say I am a typeface and design enthusiast.</p>
