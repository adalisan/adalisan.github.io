      <description>I was a researcher in the machine learning group for the Cardiovascular Research Grid project. We worked with the cardiologists who are custodians of a dataset involving patients with ICD implants. Our objective was to come up with robust, interpretable predictors that predicted either high risk of ICD utilization , or sudden cardiac death. An important challenge was to create predictors that both utilized both survival data and did not become biased due to not-missing-at-random data.</description>

      <description>My PhD thesis was on joint embedding of disparate dissimilarities for solving various inference tasks such as transfer learning, match detection and graph matching. I have dealt with various issues such as robustness to noise and compared with alternative approaches such as Canonical Correlational Analysis. Github repo</description>

      <description>This variant of the graph matching problem provides an opportunity for the application of JOFC and also the adaptation of a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm. My work on this variant of the graph matching problem constituted part of my dissertation research. This work is presented in this and this arxiv papers.
The code for the algorithm and analysis is at https://github.com/adalisan/SeededGraphMatch</description>
