      <description>My PhD thesis was on joint embedding of disparate dissimilarities for solving various inference tasks such as transfer learning, match detection and graph matching. I have dealt with various issues such as robustness to noise and compared with alternative approaches such as Canonical Correlational Analysis. Github repo</description>

      <description>This variant of the graph matching problem provides an opportunity for the application of JOFC and also the adaptation of a state-of-the-art graph matching algorithm. My work on this variant of the graph matching problem constituted part of my dissertation research. This work is presented in this and this arxiv papers.
The code for the algorithm and analysis is at https://github.com/adalisan/SeededGraphMatch</description>
