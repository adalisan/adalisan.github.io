      <description>Part of my dissertation research was on the graph matching problem. For solving this problem in real settings, it is useful to think of vertices as elements of a space with the edges determining some sort of locality, (I guess this can be formalized with topology ). Then the graph/vertex matching problem becomes sort of a point cloud matching problem where you don&amp;rsquo;t know where the points are , just the neighborhood relationships between them ( several manifold learning uses these relationships to find the manifolds defined by the points ).</description>

      <description>I have decided to switch to the academic theme for hugo , as it makes much more sense for a researcher. Now I just need to collect all the things I have done over the years.</description>

      <title>Building  R package from C codebase</title>

      <description>I have been trying to build an R package that uses C code. I was not fast enough to get a working build for some time as it is a wrapper package around an existing C library and I wanted to submit to CRAN eventually, so I needed to get a linux and windows (32 and 64-bit) builds working correctly. Building an R package even with native R code is not easy.</description>

      <description>I am in the process of creating my new personal website. I wanted to make it simple and based on a simple design with the option to generate pages without messing with HTML. That is why I am using Herring Cove. This may be overkill for a personal website.</description>
